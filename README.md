# 🛒 PySpark Sales Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive sales analysis conducted using **PySpark** on **Databricks**. It explores trends in customer purchases across countries, products, and dates — and visualizes them using an interactive HTML dashboard.

## 📌 Objective

To analyze historical sales data to:
- Identify best-performing products and customer segments.
- Understand seasonal and geographic sales trends.
- Enable data-driven decision-making through visual insights.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- 🔥 PySpark (DataFrames, SQL)
- 🧠 Databricks (for distributed computation)
- 📈 HTML (auto-generated dashboard)
- 🐍 Python

## 🧱 Project Structure

📁 pyspark-sales-analysis/
├── pyspark project (1).ipynb # PySpark code for data analysis
└── pyspark project.html # Exported dashboard (HTML)


## 📈 Key Insights
- Top products and customer regions.
- Sales trends over time.
- Repeat customer patterns and high-revenue segments.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `pyspark project (1).ipynb` in Databricks or Jupyter.
2. Execute all cells to process data.
3. Open the `pyspark project.html` file to view the final dashboard.

## 💡 Outcome
Created a functional sales dashboard that supports real-time analysis and visualization of sales data trends using PySpark on a distributed framework.
